1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It does not save a commit. that has to be done manually. you have to use git status to check on what is going on in the repository

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging is what is beign tracked and the working directory is what is not. the staging area is one step from being a commit
